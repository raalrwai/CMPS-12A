1. One error I found when using testfile1 is that if you repeat the first 
digit on a different line the statements will contradict eachother.
"the weather has been great, the weather has been ok"
2. Using testfile2 I found a grammatical error that books in question 4
becomes plural contradicting the word another used right before it.
3. Using testfile3 I found a grammatical error in question 5 where no
period appears at the end of the sentence.
4. Using testfile, I found a grammatical errror when the statement prints
out an impossible task by stating a future action will take place that
is no longer possible, "I plan to come home for a visit last weekend".
5. Using testfile 2 I noticed variable is used in the passed tense which is 
incorrect and it should be the weahter has been varient
6. Using testfile 4 I found any input value out of integers 1-2 for question
1, cause an error message to print
7. The same case for numbers 2-5, and input integer outside of 1-3 besides 
question 4 cause an error message to print.
